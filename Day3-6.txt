A. Can we initialize an array with specified elements.
B. what is the main purpose of anonymous array. And why do we need it
C. what is the main purpose of loops and why do we need them.
D. What are the loops available in java.
E. What is the difference between for and while loop.
F. Syntax for 'for' loop
G. Syntax for 'while' loop
H. Syntax for 'do-while' loop
I. Is there any specific loop that focuses only on clustered values/objects like arrays/collections
J. Syntax for 'for-each' loop
K. write a java program to store multiple values in a single variable/Identifier reference. and print the length of the array.
L. Write a java to increment the values of the array by 1.
	Example: {1,2,3,4,5,6} the output should be {2,3,4,5,6,7}
M. What is the main purpose of conditional statements and what are they
N. Syntax for 'if' statement
O. Syntax for 'if-else' statement
P. Syntax for 'else-if' ladder 
Q. Syntax for 'switch' statement
R. write a java program to increment the alternate values by 10 of an array
	Example: {1,2,3,4,5,6} the output should be {11, 2, 13, 4, 15, 6}
S. write a program to store and print even number of an array
	Example: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}  store {2,4,6,8} and print them in same line 
	Hint: use print() instead of println()

programs on loops:
T. write a java program to print 
	1
	1 2 
	1 2 3
	1 2 3 4

U. write a java program to print 
	1 2 3 4 5
	1 2 3 4
	1 2 3
	1 2
	1

V. write a java program to print
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	1 2 3 4 5
	1 2 3 4 5
	1 2 3 4
	1 2
	1 2 
	1
	Output should be in same format 

W. Complete the program in 'Day2.txt' file
X. Write an example program whare you work with 'switch' statement
Y. Write a java program to demonstrate the syntaxes of all loops and condition statements 
Z. write a java program to demonstrate the syntaxes of all types of arrays and use length on at least one array
	Example:
		one dimensional array declaration, initialization, accessing elements using index
		two dimensional array declaration, initialization, accessing elements using index
		find base length of those two arrays 
		array creation in a single line 
		anonymous array (note: use static method which returns nothing)


Programs:
	1. write a program to calculate the absolute time difference in seconds between two time stramps 
	Example: the time difference between 10:33:01 and 10:33:51 is 50 seconds 

	2. write a program to find number of matches in a string(Note the index of the character should be same from both ends)
	Example: abcdcaa total matches are 3 [a,c,d]

	3. write a program to find number of pairs are there in an array consecutively 
	Example:
		Input format:
		total values = 11;
		ON OFF OFF ON ON OFF ON OFF ON ON OFF 

		Explanation 
		pair1 : [index 0,1]
		pair2 : [2,3]
		pair3 : [4,5]
		pair4 : [6,7]
		pair5 : [7,8]
		pair6 : [9,10]

		Output:
		6
