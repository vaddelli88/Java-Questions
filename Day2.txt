Programs:
1. Tow dies are rolled for 10 times, create an array to store the each combination of Outcome and add the result of each combination and store the result in another array. find the total sum of all combination and print the result
Example:
	{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1}
	If this is the input then the output should be 20

	Note: the input should accept only numbers between 1-6 if user tries to add other then this prompt the user "You entered an incorrect input" and exit the program.
